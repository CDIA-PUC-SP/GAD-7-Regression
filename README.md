#Predicting student's mental health through linear regression.

##Contextualization:
The studies on the correlation between the variables revealed that students who exhibited high levels of anxiety generally had lower motivation to study and engage in academic activities. This finding is particularly concerning, as anxiety is a common condition among university students and can adversely affect academic performance and emotional well-being.

##Project Description:
Based on this information, we have decided to create a linear regression model in an attempt to predict the students' motivational levels based on their GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) scores. With this information in hand, it is hoped that the University can make the necessary preventive measures to improve the mental health of the students.

##Project Objective:
Training a linear regression model to predict the mental health of students
